    "text": "This is my first blog post. Welcome!\nI decided to start a blog inspired by Jeremy Howard’s Lecture 0 from the FastAI Course. Jeremy and FastAI used to maintain a blogging and publication tool called FastPages but transitioned to a new publication system called Quarto.\nThis blog is written in Quarto. Why Quarto? In the past I had attempted to used Medium and Substack but never fully spent the time to learn the tools to write a blog post. I decided to learn and publish with Quarto because of its capabilities to produce high quality scientific and technical documents with the ability to embed code and visualizations for review. Another reason why I like Quarto is how easy it is to write markdown and publish a blog.\nGoing forward I hope to use Quarto to write about my programming projects, thoughts,and improve my writing."

    "text": "I’ve recently started FastAI Practical Deep Learning for Coders to learn about machine learning. To hold myself accountable and finish the course I am going to try to write a blog post for every video in the series starting with Lesson 0. By doing this my goal is to not only learn about deep learning and track my progress but reinforce my learning by trying to explain what I’ve learned for people new to machine learning like me. Lesson 0 isn’t officially presented in the course until Lesson 3 but it provides valuable advice for how to complete FastAI and actually learn how to write deep learning code.\nLesson 0 doesn’t have any code examples or notebooks but I took Jeremy’s advice about blogging and interacting with the community by setting up this Quarto blog as the Lesson 0 project. Lesson 0 was created in 2020 before Twitter became X and closed off to people who didn’t have an account. Since then, some of the ML community and other academic communities in CS have migrated to Discord , Mastodon, and Bluesky. I’d recommend checking out the FastAI Forums, FastAI Discord, and BlueSky."

Even though my training is in computer science, I conceptually found some of the definitions that Jeremy mentioned in the lesson such as model confusing which is where the Chapter 1 of the FastAI Book filled in the gaps. I would strongly recommend checking out the definitions in this chapter because they’re still used today when talking about how a model like GPT-4."

    "text": "Terminology\n\nMachine Learning - The training of programs developed by teaching a computer learn from experience rather than coding the individual steps\nDeep Learning - A computer technique that uses layers of neural networks to extract and transform data. Neural networks layers are trained by algorithms that minimize their errors and improve their accuracy. This is how a network learns to perform a specific task. Deep learning is a sub-discipline of machine learning.\nDataset - A bunch of data ie. images, sounds, text, files or anything else.\nLabel - The data we’re trying to predict ie. dog or cat.\nIndependent Variable - Data that does not include labels\nDependent Variable - the correct label ie. dog or cat. Also called targets.\nArchitecture - The structure of the model we’re trying to fit. A mathematical function that we’re passing the input data and parameters to.\nParameters - The values in the model that change what task it can do and are updated through model training. In Arthur Samuel’s definitions the synonym for parameters is weights which has a different meaning in modern deep learning.\nParameter(Weight) Assignment - Particular choice of values for parameters.\nWeights - A particular type of model parameter.\nFit - Update the model parameters such that the predictions of the model using the input data match the target labels.\nTrain - Synoym for fit.\nPretrained Model - A model that has already been trained, generally using a large dataset and will be fine-tuned ie. resnet class of models.\nFine-Tune - Update a pretrained model for a different task.\nEpoch - One complete pass through the input data.\nLoss - A measure of how good the model is, chosen to drive training via Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).\nMetric - A measurement of how good the model is, using the validation set, chosen for human consumption.\nValidation Set - A set of data held out from training, used only for measuring how good the model is.\nTraining Set - The data used for fitting the model; does not include any data from the validation set.\nOverfitting - Training a model in such a way that it remembers specific features of the input data rather than generalizing.\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) - A type of neural network that works particularly well for computer vision tasks.\nTransfer Learning: Using a pretrained model for a task different to what it was originally trained for."
