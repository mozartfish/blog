    "text": "This is my first blog post. Welcome!\nI decided to start a blog inspired by Jeremy Howard’s Lecture 0 from the FastAI Course. Jeremy and FastAI used to maintain a blogging and publication tool called FastPages but transitioned to a new publication system called Quarto.\nThis blog is written in Quarto. Why Quarto? In the past I had attempted to used Medium and Substack but never fully spent the time to learn the tools to write a blog post. I decided to learn and publish with Quarto because of its capabilities to produce high quality scientific and technical documents with the ability to embed code and visualizations for review. Another reason why I like Quarto is how easy it is to write markdown and publish a blog.\nGoing forward I hope to use Quarto to write about my programming projects, thoughts,and improve my writing."

    "text": "I’ve recently started FastAI Practical Deep Learning for Coders to learn about machine learning. To hold myself accountable and finish the course I am going to try to write a blog post for every video in the series starting with Lecture 0. By doing this my goal is to not only learn about deep learning and track my progress but reinforce my learning by trying to explain what I’ve learned for people new to machine learning like me. Lecture 0 isn’t officially presented in the course until Lecture 3 but it provides valuable advice for how to complete FastAI and actually learn how to write deep learning code.\nLecture 0 doesn’t have any code examples or notebooks but I took Jeremy’s advice about blogging and interacting with the community by setting up this Quarto blog as the Lecture 0 project. Lecture 0 was created in 2020 before Twitter became X and closed off to people who didn’t have an account. Since then, some of the ML community and other academic communities in CS have migrated to Discord , Mastodon, and Bluesky. I’d recommend checking out the FastAI Forums and FastAI Discord since there’s an active community and study groups specifically for this course."
